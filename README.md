Arduino Uno: Controlling LCD Backlight with LiquidCrystal Library

Description :
This tutorial demonstrates how to control the backlight of a 16x2 LCD display using an Arduino Uno and a button. The provided script allows you to toggle the LCD backlight on and off with a button press, offering a simple yet practical application of Arduino's capabilities with the LiquidCrystal library.

About the Script
This script was developed by Quentin Poret and Christophe using the Tinkercad software. It uses the LiquidCrystal library to interact with a 16x2 LCD display, which is compatible with all LCD screens that utilize the Hitachi HD44780 driver (identifiable by their 16-pin interface). The example sketch displays "Hello, World!" on the LCD and demonstrates how to toggle the backlight using a button.
